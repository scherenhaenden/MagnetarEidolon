# Work-In-Progress (WIP) Guidelines for MagnetarEidolon

## WIP Limits
- Maximum **2** simultaneous tasks in `in_progress` per contributor (human or AI).

## Prioritization Rules
- Complete highest-risk/highest-value tasks first.
- Avoid starting a new task while a current one is pending review unless explicitly approved.

## Exception Policy
Exceeding WIP limit requires:
1. Governance owner approval.
2. Documented reason in this file (or linked decision record).
3. Exception entry in `BITACORA.md` with timestamp and author.

## Review Hand-off
- Move tasks to `in_review` with acceptance notes.
- Ensure dependent documents (`STATUS.md`, `PLAN.md`, `BLOCKERS.md`) are updated before hand-off.
