## Escalation Process

1.  **Creation**: Log the blocker in this file with a unique ID (e.g., `blocker-001`).
2.  **Notification**: Notify the project lead or relevant team members via `BITACORA.md` or communication channels.
3.  **Assessment**: Determine the severity and impact on the project timeline.
4.  **Escalation**: If a blocker remains unresolved for more than **one business day** (or a specified timeframe), escalate to the project governance owner.
5.  Update `STATUS.md` risks and mitigation actions.
6.  Add escalation context to `BITACORA.md`.
7.  Re-prioritize impacted tasks in `PLAN.md`.
8.  **Resolution**: Once resolved, update the status to `Resolved` and document the solution in `BITACORA.md`. Close blocker only after documenting resolution evidence.
