# Branching Model for System Interaction Module Skeleton

This project follows a GitFlow-inspired model:
- `master` is the stable release branch.
- `develop` (optional) aggregates completed work.
- `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, `experiment/*`, and `hotfix/*` are short-lived working branches.
- Pull requests must reference task IDs and include documentation updates.
