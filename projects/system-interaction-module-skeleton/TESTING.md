# Testing Strategy for System Interaction Module Skeleton

## Types of Tests
- Unit tests for each core interface and adapter contract.
- Integration tests for cross-component interactions.
- End-to-end smoke tests for the main module flows.

## Code Coverage
Target at least **80%** automated coverage for module logic and critical contracts.

## Bug Reporting Process
1. Create a bug entry with reproduction steps and expected/actual results.
2. Link affected task IDs and milestone.
3. Track remediation progress in `PLAN.md` and `BITACORA.md`.
4. Close only after tests validate the fix.
