## Risks and Mitigations
1. **Risk:** Governance drift between Markdown docs and YAML project state.  
   **Mitigation:** Enforce synchronized updates through PR checklist and BITACORA entries.
2. **Risk:** Ambiguous task transitions during rapid delivery.  
   **Mitigation:** Restrict to canonical states and document every change in `BITACORA.md`.
3. **Risk:** Blockers not escalated in time.  
   **Mitigation:** Apply 1-business-day escalation policy from `BLOCKERS.md`.

## Reporting Cadence
Update at least once per day and immediately after each merged PR.
